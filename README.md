Timetabling

Timetabling Software used to create timetables with four algorithms. The timetables are created with different graph coloring algorithms 
(Greedy Welsh-Powell, Largest Saturation Degree, Recursive Largest First and a modification of the Tabu search algorithm). Their results are then displayed individually. 
Also, there is a possibility to review the efficiency of each algorithm (colors used, duration, visual representation of a colored graph).

Requirements: 
- Python 3.9.2;
- Pip.

Installation:
1) Go to the project location with powershell;
2) input "pip install -r requirements.txt" command into powershell;
3) Start the project with "python app.py";
